My interests are diverse, ranging from science fiction books by authors such as Isaac Asimov, to economics and philosophy, including works by Richard Dawkins, Ayn Rand, and Aristotle. I am a critical thinker who enjoys delving into complex topics and finding new ways of understanding the world around me.

In my free time, I enjoy indulging in my love for film, with a particular interest in the works of Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, and Jim Jarmusch. I am also an avid fan of music, particularly from the 70s and 80s, as well as rock, metal, and j-rock. Video games are another passion of mine, particularly RPGs and competitive games like Planetside 2. I have also dedicated much of my life to MMORPGs and resource management games.

Overall, I am a person who is always eager to explore new areas of knowledge and experience new things. Whether it's through books, film, music, or games, I am driven by a constant thirst for learning and discovery.
